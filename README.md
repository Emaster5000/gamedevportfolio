# Ethan Mabey's Game Development Portfolio
First year game dev student interested in Splatoon, Celeste, Rumble, and music, both playing and listening.
I have decent knowledge of Java and C++, and made a couple projects with C++.
Would like to maybe make mods for games, particularly Celeste, or be a part of cool projects.
